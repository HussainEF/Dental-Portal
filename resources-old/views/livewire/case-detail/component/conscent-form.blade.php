        <br>
        The following Terms and Conditions Agreement (“Agreement”) constitutes a binding contract between you
        (“Doctor”) and ClearPath Orthodontics Pvt. Ltd. /ClearPath Manufacturing Pvt. Ltd. By submitting a case to
        ClearPath Orthodontics Pvt. Ltd. /ClearPath Manufacturing Pvt. Ltd. Doctor agrees to abide by the following Terms
        and Conditions. Doctor &amp; ClearPath may each be referred to herein as a “Party” or collectively as the “Parties”.
        <br><br>

        <b>1. Product Information</b><br>
        ClearPath manufactures clear, removable, medical grade plastic appliances (“aligners”) customized to fit the
        patients&#39; teeth. When both arches are being treated, a pair of aligners (one for each arch) is referred to as an
        “aligner”. In single-arch treatment, one aligner constitutes a stage by itself. Aligners are manufactured and
        delivered over time altogether, and also as groups, referred to as “batches”, as per the treatment requirements.
        There are two types of aligners. “Active aligners” are designed to apply pressure to specific teeth to induce
        movement. “Retainers” (also known as “Passive aligners”) are designed to maintain the existing position of teeth.
        <br><br>

        <b>2. Case submission and payment</b><br>
        A sequence of treatment with aligners (a “case) can be prescribed either via the website located at
        http://www.clearpathortho.com or by submitting a printed case submission form to ClearPath Orthodontics. 100%
        of the amount is due at the time of case submission. By submitting a case Doctor authorizes ClearPath
        Orthodontics to charge the fee associated to the case procedures. If the Doctor, after the case submission
        terminates the treatment up till the Digital Diagnostic Setup, ClearPath has the right to recover 40% of the total
        amount received/receivable from him in order to cover the cost expenditures after the case submission. If the
        Doctor discontinues the treatment once the Digital Diagnostic Setup has been approved and aligner manufacturing
        has started, ClearPath has the right to recover 100% of the amount in order to cover the cost expenditures.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>3. Active and Inactive cases</b><br>
        Aligners can only be requested for a case while it is active.
        Cases are automatically inactivated (“closed”) when “Doctor requests a final retainer.
        A case may also be closed if required records are not received within 30 days of case submission”.
        A case may also be closed if the amount is not received within 03 days of case submission”.
        <br><br>

        <b>4. Treatment options</b><br>
        ClearPath offers the following treatment options:
        CP-A: Includes Digital Setup and all Aligners (Max 20 aligners) with Retainer. No Mid-course correction and No

        (NOTE: All extraction cases and/or cases requiring more than 20 Aligners fall in CP-B and CP-B+ category.)
        <br><br>

        <br><br>

        <b>Digital Setup:</b>
        At the beginning of all active treatment cases, ClearPath generates a representation of the treatment plan (a
        “digital setup”). This includes digital models representing the estimated position of the teeth pre- and post-
        treatment, as well as estimates of the duration of the case and the amount of recommended IPR.
        Doctor can request a case evaluation without committing to a full course of treatment:
        Case review (free): Includes a case type recommendation, based on photos, x-rays and Doctor&#39;s description.
        <br><br>

        <b>5. Revisions</b>
        Doctor may request a revision to any active case by submitting a case revision form to ClearPath Orthodontics,
        along with new impressions if necessary. Doctor is responsible for any additional cost incurring due to the revision
        requested by doctor.
        If a case revision extends the length of planned treatment beyond the number of steps included with the case,
        Doctor must upgrade to another treatment option with sufficient steps to complete the revision, or purchase extra
        aligners. Any aligner that shipped before a revision request is processed will be counted against the number of
        steps allowed for the case. To avoid wasting aligners, Doctor should notify ClearPath Orthodontics as soon as a
        revision is anticipated.
        <br><br>

        <b>6. Curtailment</b><br>
        The following restrictions apply to all cases:
         ClearPath Orthodontics will not manufacture aligners for closed cases.
         A case cannot be reopened once closed. Doctor must submit a new case to request additional aligners.
         Doctor agrees to request no more aligners than necessary to achieve the approved treatment plan.

         ClearPath Orthodontics reserves the right to reject case revisions if the patient or Doctor has failed to
        defer to the product instructions or the treatment plan has changed.
         ClearPath Orthodontics reserves the right to cancel the treatment without refund if Doctor is suspected of
        abusing these policies.
        <br><br>

        <b>7. Cancellation and refunds</b><br>
        If Doctor cancels a case before approving a treatment setup, ClearPath Orthodontics will have the right to recover
        40% of the amount given by the doctor / Doctor will be responsible to pay 60% of the case charges.
        If Doctor cancels a case after approving a treatment setup, ClearPath Orthodontics will not refund any of the case
        fee paid for that case in order to cover the cost expenditures / Doctor will be responsible to pay up till 100% of the
        case charges.
        <br><br>

        <b>8. Validity</b><br>
        For all case categories validity of the case is bases on 10 days each aligner wearing, 22 hours per day. Treating
        dentist to ensure compliance as per ClearPath protocols &amp; any issue should be reported on time within validity of
